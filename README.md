Hello, I'm Gadagoju Shiva, and I'm a motivated DevOps fresher. I have a good understanding of AWS, Docker, CI/CD, Jenkins, Bash scripting, and Kubernetes. I've completed certifications in DevOps, CI/CD, Python, and MySQL, which demonstrate my commitment to learning and improving my skills.

One of my notable achievements was leading a project to move an existing application from an on-premises environment to the AWS cloud. This involved modernizing the infrastructure, making it more scalable, and reducing costs. I assessed the existing infrastructure, planned the migration, and set up the necessary AWS cloud environment. I also worked on replicating the on-premises servers using EC2 instances in AWS and made sure they performed well. I used AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) and Auto Scaling to handle the application's traffic and ensure it was always available. Additionally, I migrated data from on-premises storage to Amazon S3, keeping it safe and accessible.

Apart from technical skills, I'm also proficient in Vagrant, Python, MySQL, HTML/CSS, and Linux. I have a keen interest in improving workflows and working as part of a dynamic team. During my projects, I gained experience in automating the setup and management of infrastructure using tools like AWS CloudFormation and AWS CLI.

I'm passionate about delivering high-quality solutions and continuously improving my skills. I believe my technical knowledge and adaptability to new technologies would make me a valuable addition to any team.

Thank you for considering my application, and I'm looking forward to discussing how I can contribute to your organization's success.
